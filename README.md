# practice_With_AI

For the back:
Type "nodemon app.js" in the console to run the program

For the front:
Type "npm start" in the terminal

The technologies used were:

Javascript as language.

The backend is built with Node and express; using dotenv, nodemon, cors, and openAI.
The front end is made with react.

I use local storage to locally save the quotes viewed and to be able to create the history with the last 4 generated.
